## Inspiration
The idea for MathSpace was born out of a simple need â€“ to make math fun and approachable for kids. We wanted to strip away the intimidation factor often associated with math and turn it into a game that kids would reach for with enthusiasm.

## What it does
MathSpace is a straightforward game that challenges kids to solve math problems under time pressure. It tests their quick thinking and reinforces their arithmetic skills through practice and repetition, with a sprinkle of excitement.

## How we built it
We built MathSpace using Unity, a powerful engine that's great for 2D game development. We scripted in C#, leveraging Unity's user-friendly interface to design a game that's simple for kids but powerful in its capability to provide a dynamic learning experience.

## Challenges we ran into
One major challenge was designing an algorithm that could generate math problems of varying difficulty adaptively. We also worked hard to create a UI that would be engaging for kids without being distracting.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating an educational game that kids actually enjoy. The positive feedback from our young testers has been incredibly fulfilling, affirming our goal to make learning math fun.

## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we learned a lot about child psychology and the importance of gamification in education. We also improved our technical skills with Unity and C# and got better at debugging and user testing.

## What's next for MathSpace
Looking ahead, we plan to expand MathSpace with more levels, incorporate parental controls and progress tracking, and explore the addition of new subjects beyond math to create a comprehensive educational platform for children.
